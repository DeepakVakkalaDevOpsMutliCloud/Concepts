How to know the size of network

size of network
2 * n-2
n is no.of bits in host id

##Example-1 Calculating the Number of Usable IP Addresses in a Network (or)
            How many no.0f devices can i connect to the network?

IP Address: 10.0.1.7
Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0
network-id - 10
host-id - 0.1.7
2 * n -2
n is no.of bits in host id (3 * 8(bits) = 24bits)
16,777,214

Example 2: Determining the CIDR Notation for 2000 Usable Devices


2000 devices
2 * 11 = 2048 which is greater than the count 2000
2 * 11 is considered
n is host id octets
2 * n = 11 (hostid)
host id = 11
netwokr id = 32 - 11 = 21

##Example-3 Expanding CIDR 192.168.128.0/18 to Determine the IP Range
expand cidr 192.168.128.0/18
            first try to write subnet mask 
             11111111.11111111.11000000.00000000
             [11111111.11111111.11] is fixed
             [000000.00000000] is variable
             then try to expand 128 as decimal form,here as 18 comes in the 3rd octet
             then write starting ip
                       192.168.10000000.00000000 = 192.168.128.0 
               in this ---.---.--******.******** = - are fixed , * varies
               possibilities are all 0 and all 1
               192.168.10000000.00000000 = 192.168.128.0
               192.168.10111111.11111111
                       192.168.10111111.00000000 = 192.168.191.255             
..................
10.0.0.0 > 198.168.0.0 no.of connection of devices


10.0.0.0/8      >  more devices can connect
172.16.0.0/12   >
192.158.0.0/16

...........................
10.0.0.0/20
10.0.0.0/19

10.0.0.0/19 can connect to more devices
.........................

subnet mask

we should take N which is always greater than N of private ip addresses
(10.0.0.0/8       
 172.16.0.0/12   
 192.158.0.0/16)

if N is 23 then we should take 10.0.0.0/8 ,172.16.0.0/12 , 192.158.0.0/16 
if N is 9  then we should take 10.0.0.0/8
